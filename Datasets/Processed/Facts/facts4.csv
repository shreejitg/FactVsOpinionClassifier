Honolulu is the capital and largest city of Hawaii, on the southeast coast of the island of Oahu
The city is legally coextensive with the county of Honolulu, which includes the entire island of Oahu and most of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, from Nihoa to Kure Atoll, except Midway
The population of Oahu makes up 73% of the state's total population
It is situated in the central Pacific Ocean 2,397 mi west-southwest of San Francisco. Honolulu's name derives from the native words hono, meaning “a bay,” and lulu, meaning “sheltered.”
Honolulu's early history was one of turbulence and conflict
One of the last areas on the globe to be explored and exploited by Europeans (it was first visited by British captain James Cook in 1778), Hawaii was subject to strong pressures from many forces, including American missionaries, who arrived in 1820, and opportunistic whalers
These whalers were among those who built Honolulu originally, bringing trade, commerce, and prosperity that led to expansion into the sugar and pineapple industries
As early as 1814, Russia tried to move in, and Russian soldiers built a bastion at the harbor's edge. The British flag was raised in 1843 and French forces occupied Honolulu in 1849
Each time control was returned to the independent native kingdom without bloodshed
In 1898, a group of Americans completed a project attempted at intervals during the previous 65 years—annexation to the United States. Honolulu was incorporated as a city in 1907
The Honolulu area was bombed by Japan in a surprise attack on the unprepared U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. This action forced the United States to enter World War II
“Remember Pearl Harbor” became a famous American wartime slogan
Hawaiian statehood in 1959 and the viability of commercial air travel to the island brought boom times to Honolulu
Tourism is the city's principal industry, followed by federal defense expenditures and agricultural exports (chiefly pineapples)
